Calculating Cost of a Fence Project

Var length
Var width
Var perimeter
Var numGates
Var fenceType
Var costPerFoot
Var buildingPermitCost
Var taxRate
Var taxAmount
Var finalCost
Var subTotal

Set buildingPermitCost = 50.00
Set taxRate = 0.06

Prompt user for yard length
Get length
Prompt user for yard width
Get width
Prompt user for fence type
Get fenceType
Prompt user for number of gates
Get numGates

If !(0 < numGates < 4)
	Display message “Must have at least 1, but not more than 3 gates”
	Prompt user for number of gates
	Get numGates
End If

Calculate perimeter = 2 * width + 2 * length

If (fenceType is Wooden)
	Set costPerFoot = 25
Else
	Set costPerFoot = 15
End IfElse

Calculate subTotal = costPerFoot * perimeter + numGates * 150
Calculate taxAmount = subTotal * taxRate
Calculate finalCost = subTotal + taxAmount + buildingPermitCost
